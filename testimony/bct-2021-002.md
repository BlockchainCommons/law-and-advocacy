* At the [May 27, and 28, 2021](https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-20210527MeetingMinutes.pdf), meeting of the Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology on the subject of Digital Identity, Christopher shared his suggestions that we make digital identity v. personal identifiable data v. digital personal data differences distinctions. He recommended constraints similar to Europe that Google, Facebook, etc. are already having to comply with. He would like Wyoming law to clarify principal authority to protect the individual and consumers.
