# Law & Advocacy

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Christopher Allen, et. al_

**Blockchain Commons** advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure & compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online. Some of our work is technical, focused on the creation and usage of interoperable specifications, but some of our work is legislative, because the legal foundations for self-sovereign control of digital assets are just as important as the technical foundations.

## Creating a Legal Foundation

We believe that it's crucial to create a legal foundation for digital rights. Our advocacy is thus focused on identifying legal underpinnings that will lead us to the secure, compassionate, self-sovereign digital infrastructure that we envision and then supporting the incorporation of those foundations into law.

To date, much of our work has been with the Wyoming lesiglature, who we believe is setting national precedent with their future-looking laws on digital assets and identity. We've supported their work to create two important foundations for self-sovereign digital control of assets:

* **Identity Definition.** [WY SF0039 (2021)](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039) provided a foundational definition of digital identity that we found most crucial for its inclusion of "principal authority" as part of the core definition. Our article ["Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity"](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/) explains the importance of this legal term and how it leads to self-sovereign identity.
* **Private Key Protection.**[WY HB0086 (2023)](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0086) recognized private keys as being special and offered protections for them, which were previously being required by courts. Our article ["Private Key Disclosure: A Needless Threat to Rights and Assets"](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/) explains the importance as this, and how private keys are the building block for identity on the internet.

Together we believe these two bills lay out the crucial foundation to give users self-sovereign control of their digital selves and assets online. Clearly, there's lots more to do, including the laying of many more building blocks, but we're proud of these two successes and hope to see more like them in the future.

## Why Advocacy Continues to Be Important

Advocacy is one of the ways that we transform ideas like our [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) into reality. Without them there are three major dangers:

1. That laws are encated that hand off digital identities and assets to corporations, not individuals.
2. That laws are enacted that innately support less secure or less personal methods of asset control
3. That laws are encated that ignore the requirements or dangers of digital assets and identity.

Obviously, we want the internet to support individuals, not corporations, so that everyone can benefit from it equally. But corporate cronyism may be the least of our problems. A bigger danger is that laws are written 

 Work with Wyoming has been particularly important, advised on specifics of things like Gordian Principles under digital assets, but also property law doesn't work for digital identity, so we've been suggesting foundational stuff with intersection of tech & law: digital identity bill, principle authority, protecting private keys, WRDA

## Legal Testimony

Much of our work toward creating these foundations can be found in our Testimony to Wyoming and other bodies:

* [**Blockchain Commons Testimony**](testimony/README.md) — An (incomplete) listing of our testimony.

## Other Legal Sources

We've also created documents to help define the lay of the land at the current time.

* [**Blockchain Legal Terminology & Definitions**](https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg) — An overview of current usage.
* [**Blockchain Laws**](https://hackmd.io/5ec69mqLRaanS5A1IWBuMQ) — A rough listing of current laws.

## Other Organizations

We're thrilled that other organizations are advocating for similar visions.

* [**COPA**](https://www.opencrypto.org/) — We are [members of](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/partnerships/BCC-Joins-COPA/) the [Crypto Open Patent Alliance](https://www.opencrypto.org/).
* [**EFF**](https://www.eff.org/) — We are big fans of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).
