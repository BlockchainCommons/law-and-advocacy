# Law & Advocacy

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Christopher Allen, et. al_

Blockchain Commons isn't just about technological development. It also works to ensure that there's a solid legal foundation for our blockchain technologies. **Law & Advocacy** collects our work of this sort.

## Why Advocacy?

Though much of Blockchain Commons' work focuses on technical specifications and on libraries and apps that demonstrate those specification, the foundation of that work is ultimately advocacy. We want to create open & interoperable, secure & compassionate digital infrastructure. In other words, we want to create a _human_ and _humane_ internet.

Many of our top advocacy goals appear on our [Vision page](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html). 

Most notably, we want to:

* Define and advocate a new techno-social contract of decentralized infrastructure, based on human dignity, respect for the individual, and mutual benefit for all contributors.

We don't want the internet to be built for the corporations, we want it to be built for the individuals, and for it to benefit everyone equally.

## The Gordian Principles

More of our [Vision](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html) is embedded in our [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles). We advocate for software that meets four primary goals:

* **Independence.** We want to safeguard user freedom from involuntary oversight or external control.
* **Privacy.** We want to protect against coercion by advocating non-correlation, privacy, and pseudonymity.
* **Resilience.** We want to protect against the likelihood of losing digital assets via any means.
* **Openness.** We want to support open infrastructure that allow users to freely move their data among many apps.

## Legal Testimony

Specifications offer a bottom-up approach to advocacy, giving developers the tools to make our vision of a human internet a reality. However, advocacy also requires a top-down approach: working with legislatures to ensure that laws reflect our goals and don't run counter to them. 

The following files are general overviews related to legislation.

* [**Blockchain Commons Testimony**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Testimony) — An (incomplete) listing of our testimony.
* [**Blockchain Legal Terminology & Definitions**](https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg) — An overview of current usage.
* [**Blockchain Laws**](https://hackmd.io/5ec69mqLRaanS5A1IWBuMQ) — A rough listing of current laws.

## Legal Advocacy

While working with legislatures, we've also advocated for specific topics that the law-makers were working on. Here's a few notable topics and why they're important:

* [**Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity**](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/) — A new legal foundation for self-sovereign identity in Wyoming.
* [**Private Key Disclosure: A Needless Threat to Rights and Assets**](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/) — How courts are forcing disclosure of private keys, and why that's the wrong thing to do.

## Other Organizations

We're thrilled that other organizations are advocating for similar visions.

* [**COPA**](https://www.opencrypto.org/) — We are [members of](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/partnerships/BCC-Joins-COPA/) the [Crypto Open Patent Alliance](https://www.opencrypto.org/).
* [**EFF**](https://www.eff.org/) — We are big fans of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
