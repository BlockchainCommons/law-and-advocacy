## Introduction


### Why Gather Legal Defintions? 
Legal defintions serve as the leading guide to stability and direction for actors engaged in the realm of blockchain. In the fast evolving field of blockchain, people inside and outside of the blockchain community struggle to explain and arrive at a central way to define and explain various terms. The purpose of the different blockchain-centric legal definitions is to allow citizens and other relevant actors to understand the different terms in a closely related manner.

The purpose of this project is to serve as a collaborative platform to gather the sundry of ideas from the blockchain community to assist law makers in their pursuit to bring stability for blockchain and the law. In the last three years, several States continue to push forward legislation that define blockchain related terms. The sudden growth of this legislation is promising, but it must be done with caution and careful advoacy from those willing and able to provide expertise. 

*This document serves as a non-exhaustive resource that should be continually updated as more legislation is created and discovered.*
