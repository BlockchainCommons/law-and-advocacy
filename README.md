# Law & Advocacy

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Christopher Allen, et. al_

Blockchain Commons isn't just about technological development. It also works to ensure that there's a solid legal foundation for our blockchain technologies. **Law & Advocacy** collects our work of this sort.

## Why Advocacy?

Though much of Blockchain Commons' work focuses on technical specifications and libraries and apps that demonstrate those specification, the foundation of that work is ultimately advocacy. We want to create open & interoperable, secure & compassionate digital infrastructure. In other words, we want to create a _human_ and _humane_ internet.

Many of our top advocacy goals appear on our [Vision page](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html). 

Most notably, we want to:

* Define and advocate a new techno-social contract of decentralized infrastructure, based on human dignity, respect for the individual, and mutual benefit for all contributors.

We don't want the internet to be built for the corporations, we want it to be guilt for the individuals, and for it to benefit everyone equally.

## The Gordian Principles

More of our [vision](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html) is embedded in our [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles). We advocate for software that meets four primary goals:

* **Independence.** We want to safeguard user freedom from involuntary oversight or external control.
* **Privacy.** We want to protect against coercion with non-correlation, privacy, and pseudonymity.
* **Resilience.** We want to protect against the likelihood of losing digital assets via any means.
* **Openness.** We want to support open infrastructure that allow users to freely move their data among many apps.

## Legal Testimony

Specifications offer a bottom-up approach to advocacy: giving developers the tools to make our vision of a human internet a reality. However, advocacy also requires a top-down approach: working with legislatures to ensure that laws reflect our goals and don't run counter to them. 

The following files are general overviews related to legislation.

* [**Blockchain Legal Terminology & Definitions**](https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg) — An overview of current usage.
* [**Blockchain Commons Testimony**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Testimony) — An (incomplete) listing of our testimony.

## Legal Advocacy

While working with legislatures, we've also advocated for specific topics that the law-makers were working on. Here's why they're important:

* [**Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity**](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/) — A new legal foundation for self-sovereign identity in Wyoming.
* [**Private Key Disclosure: A Needless Threat to Rights and Assets**](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/) — How courts are forcing disclosure of private keys, and why that's the wrong thing to do.

## Other Organizations

We're thrilled that other organizations are advocating for similar visions.

* [**COPA**](https://www.opencrypto.org/) We are [members of](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/partnerships/BCC-Joins-COPA/) the [Crypto Open Patent Alliance](https://www.opencrypto.org/).
* [**EFF**](https://www.eff.org/) — We are big fans of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
