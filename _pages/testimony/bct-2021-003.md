At the [September 21, and 22, 2021](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Committees/2021/S19), meeting of the Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology:
* On the subject of **Digital Identity**, Christopher discussed design principles of self sovereign identity and advised the Committee that now that Wyoming has the first legal definition of  personal digital identity, they should next look at defining responsibilities and limitations for delegated partial authority. He also shared this written article: [Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity](https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092117-02DigitalIDpresentation.pdf). 
* On the subject of **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**, Christopher discussed current work on principal authority and agency law, and suggested the Select Committee consider language in regard to the existence of principal authority and to define control. During the public comment session Christopher shared his suggestions on balancing technical and legal focus in the final language, public identifier requirements, and resolve how DAO can have synergies with series corporation statues.
